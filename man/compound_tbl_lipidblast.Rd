\title{Extract compound data from LipidBlast}
\usage{
compound_tbl_lipidblast(file, collapse = character(), n = -1L, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{\code{character(1)} with the name of the file name.}

\item{collapse}{optional \code{character(1)} to be used to collapse multiple
values in the columns \code{"synonyms"}. See examples for details.}

\item{n}{\code{integer(1)} defining the number of rows from the json file that
should be read and processed at a time. By default (\code{n = -1L}) the
complete file is imported and processed. For large json files it is
suggested to set e.g. \code{n = 100000} to enable chunk-wise processing and
hence reduce the memory demand.}

\item{verbose}{\code{logical(1)} whether some progress information should be
provided. Defaults to \code{verbose = FALSE}, but for parsing very large
files (specifically with chunk-wise processing enabled with \code{n} > 0)
it might be helpful to set to \code{verbose = TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A \link[tibble:tibble]{tibble::tibble} with general compound information (one row per
compound):
\itemize{
\item \code{compound_id}: the ID of the compound.
\item \code{name}: the compound's name.
\item \code{inchi}: the InChI of the compound.
\item \code{inchikey}: the InChI key. \code{NA} for all compounds as it is ot provided
in MoNA json files.
\item \code{formula}: the chemical formula.
\item \code{exactmass}: the compound's mass.
\item \code{synonyms}: the compound's synonyms (aliases). This type of this column is
by default a \code{list} to support multiple aliases per compound, unless
argument \code{collapse} is provided, in which case multiple synonyms are pasted
into a single element separated by the value of \code{collapse}.
}
}
\description{
\code{compound_tbl_lipidblast()} extracts basic compound annotations from a
LipidBlast file in (json format) downloaded from
http://mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/downloads . Note that no mass spectra data
is extracted from the json file.
